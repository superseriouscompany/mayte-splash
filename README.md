1. Update package.json && package-lock.json && dist/index.html to the proper naming stuff for the new project (would be LIT to create some global cmd that bootstrapped this boilerplate for you...)

2. `npm install`

3. from project root `webpack --watch`

4. make sure you have a server (e.g serve) installed `npm install -g serve` and then serve the dist directory e.g `serve dist`
